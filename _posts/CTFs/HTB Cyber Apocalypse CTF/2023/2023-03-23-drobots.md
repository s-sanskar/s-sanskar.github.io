Pandora's latest mission as part of her reconnaissance training is to infiltrate the Drobots firm that was suspected of engaging in illegal activities. Can you help pandora with this task?


## Overview

Welcome! In this blog post, we'll explore a fun challenge called Drobots, where you'll help Pandora infiltrate the Drobots firm suspected of engaging in illegal activities. We'll walk through the source code, understand the vulnerabilities, and exploit them to retrieve the flag. Let's get started!


## Understanding the Source Code

To begin, let's examine the source code provided to us. The code is divided into different files, and we'll focus on the key files that will help us understand the vulnerabilities and exploit them.

#### Database Setup: 

The first file we encounter is `entrypoint.sh`, which sets up the database and inserts an admin user with a randomly generated password. Here's a snippet from the code:

<!-- this is code block for entrypoint.sh -->
```sql
CREATE DATABASE drobots;
CREATE TABLE drobots.users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username varchar(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password varchar(255) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO drobots.users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', '$(genPass)');
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'M@k3l@R!d3s$';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON drobots.users TO 'user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
```

This code creates a database called `drobots` and a table called `users` to store user information. It inserts an admin user with a randomly generated password. We'll need this information to log in later.

#### Flag Location

Next, let's take a look at `routes.py`, specifically the `/home` route, where we can find the flag. Here's the relevant part:

<!-- this is code block for routes.py -->
```js
@web.route('/home')
@isAuthenticated
def home():
    return render_template('home.html', flag=flag)
```


In this code snippet, we see that the `/home` route is protected by an `isAuthenticated` decorator. This means we need to log in to access the flag. Once authenticated, the `home.html` template is rendered, and the flag is passed as a variable.


### SQL Injection Vulnerability

The login functionality in `routes.py` contains a significant vulnerability: it's susceptible to SQL injection. Here's the relevant code snippet:

```python
# We should update our code base and use techniques like parameterization to avoid SQL Injection

user = query_db(f'SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = "{username}" AND password = "{password}" ', one=True)
```


In this snippet, we can observe that the `username` and `password` values are directly interpolated into the SQL query string. This allows an attacker to manipulate the query by injecting SQL code. Our goal is to exploit this vulnerability to bypass the login and retrieve the flag.


## Exploiting the Vulnerability

Now that we understand the vulnerabilities present in the code, it's time to exploit them and retrieve the flag. The following steps outline the process:

1. Craft the payload: We need to construct a payload that exploits the SQL injection vulnerability. In this case, we can use the following payload as the password:

```
" OR 1=1; --
```

2. Send the payload: We'll use a tool like Burp Suite to send the payload to the server. The payload will be sent as a JSON object in the login request (`POST /api/login HTTP/1.1`). Here's an example of the payload:

```json
{"username":"admin' --","password":"\" OR 1=1; --"}
```

3. Retrieve the flag: With the payload sent, the SQL injection will bypass the login and grant us access. We can then navigate to the `/home` route, which will render the `home.html` template and reveal the flag.

3. Flag retrieval: After successful exploitation, we can find the flag in the rendered `home.html` template. The flag for this challenge is:

```
HTB{p4r4m3t3r1z4t10n_1s_1mp0rt4nt!!!}	
```

## Review

The Drobots challenge provides a perfect opportunity for beginners to learn about SQL injection. By examining the source code and understanding the vulnerabilities, we were able to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability and retrieve the flag. It is essential to always read the comments and analyze the source code thoroughly to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Remember, SQL injection is a prevalent vulnerability that can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. As a developer, it's crucial to employ best practices like parameterization to prevent SQL injection attacks.

I hope this beginner's guide has given you a solid foundation in understanding and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities. Stay curious, keep learning, and continue exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity!
