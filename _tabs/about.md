I am a senior at George Mason University studying Information Technology (concentrating in Cybersecurity). 

Here are my interests:
- Code security
- Reverse engineering 
- Vulnerability research (exploit development)
- IoT & embedded systems

> My main focus is Application Security.

I am also interested in how cloud and AI/ML can be used to automate tedious tasks.


I am Learning C (programming language), assembly (x86), and reverse engineering right now.
